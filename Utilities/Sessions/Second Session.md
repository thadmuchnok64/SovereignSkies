Their resources and riches allowed them to gather powerful wizards, scientists, workers, and soldiers to assert their dominance in this new world.

To open final door:

"Can we please for the love of [Zephyr] find another way to open that damn door at the entrance of the cave? I don't carry that many copper coins on me. It's a pain throwing them into the two little ponds every time I want to open it."
