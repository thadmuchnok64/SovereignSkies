the gang arrives at thieves hideaway.

There is a single dock which has a dirt trail that goes into a lush forest.

___
The gang enters the cave and it gets real dark.
They come across a rickety bridge which spans 50 feet
at the end of the chasm, there is an iron door with a slit at the top of it.

When knocked on, the slit opens. You see big serious eyes surrounded by green skin, and a deep voice which says: "Whats the passphrase?"
This guy is [[Bruce]]

The passphrase is [To light a candle is to cast a shadow]

The players can either guess the code, unlikely, or bribe him, or try to use force, or convince him.

Inside, the gang sees the [[Thieves Guild]] entrance.
