**Intro**
You are high on the seas sailing through Backwater Bay.
It's a violent night on the waters. Your crew is all working in unison to safely navigate through the rocky seas. Suddenly... There's an iceberg.

[Nature Check] with advantage It's odd that theres an iceberg here. These waters are too warm.

Suddenly, you all hear a voice. The voice disorients you all, causing you all to mess up in your own way Everybody describe how you mess up your job, and describe how your character looks while you're at it.

And then... IMPACT.

First there is the cold, then the stillness. You take a second to look at your fellow sailors, and then there is nothing.

You blink. You blink again. Between those blinks were a hundered years.

Another hundered passes

All of the sudden, [closet person to the back of the ship] hears a large crack right in front of them.

You breifly see a blurry greenish brown face in front of you. They help you out of the ice. You pass out.

An hour or so passes.

[ask party] Who is the first to wake up?

A greenish wood elf with bulky goggles, overalls, and messy curly hair approaches you holding a warm mug of mysterious brown liquid (hot chocolate). 

"Take it, we need to get you warm."

You hear the fire crackling by your side. You have a blanket on top of you. You see your comrades all sleeping by the fire.

Harper introduces herself.

Theres a dwarf there. Grumpy and not talkative. He has a red shirt and pants, long messy red hair and a messier beard.

Harper addresses the Dwarf:

"Thanks so much. I owe you one."

"You owe me several, but- dont worry about it. Just make sure these chumps were worth pulling out of that ice"

He waves her away "I'll see you back at town"


[[Harper Convo]]
[[Harper]] needs to talk about
* How are you all feeling?
* You all missed a lot of history... Maybe our town historian can fill you all in.
* Thats a real shame about your ship...
* I think I can fix your ship. You just need to help me with one thing...


We trade with the Federation quite a bit... but they're starting to get mad at us.
They keep saying that their traders arent returning here, and we have no idea why.
The only thing we can think is that they're getting stuck on monkey island.

While you're at monkey island, we need to get a bunch of bamboo cloth. I know a trader there that
gives me agood price. If you figure out this mystery, I'll fix up your ship for you.

[Monkey Court]
You and your comrades wake in in a... courtroom?

A dishelved looking monkey barges through the door. He's wearing a white button up shirt which is way too tight. If a monkey could have a comb-over, this monkey has one. He has thick glasses which he keeps needing to push up his nose, and papers keep falling out of his binder.

Dunderbob walks over to the party.


Dunderbob in a dumb voice: Uh oh. Sorry I'm late. Look, you guys are looking at 20 years minumum for what you all did.

Dunderbob has a binder with the evidence:

**MONKEY FORENSICS RESULTS:**
13 discovered humanoid bodies. Bodies were brutally destroyed and dessicated beyond recognition. Some bodies were killed as soon as an hour ago, others were found to be dead for at least 6 hours.
8 Dead monkey bodies. Some bodies died an hour ago, others dead 4 hours ago.

**WOOD STRIPS:**
Some Federation soldiers were crucified on wooden crosses then burned. Detective grizzly was able to pick pieces of wood with certain letters etched into them...

-------- O- ---ON-- CO--TRU-----
----ER-- O- ------T C--S---C----
-R--E--- -F CO----- ---ST----IO-
--O---TY -- -----U- --N------IO-

**Dunderbob's Attorney Badge:**
Nobody would believe dunderbob is an attorney if he didnt have this.

Your conversation is interrupted by the sound of a gavel.

[Judge] : Attention everybody! We are brought here today to settle the case of Monkey Island vs... Uh what did you all say your names were?

How about Monkey Vs Pirates

We bring our first witness to the stand. In steps [[Detective Grizzly]]

[Grizzly] : Yeah. I saw those bastards scurring away with MY stuff I left in MY chest. I've been trying to hunt down this murderous bastard for 5 years. Now i'm finally staring the devil in the eye.


Bring in the 2nd witness!
Two monkeys escort [Harper] onto the podium
[Harper] : Look, I dont think these people are bad people. Besides, I just freed them from ice like a few hours ago. You all wouldnt hurt other people for no reason, would you... Right? She looks at you all.

Monkey Prosecutor: And Mrs. Harper... how long have you known these men?

Harper: About... an hour. This causes the court to break out into wispered monkey noises.

Monkey Prosecutor: No further questions your honor.

Lets bring out our final witness

Big Henry walks out. (It's the same gorilla as before)
"Yes, I saw these individuals... Violently murdering innocent federation soldiers. For what reason? Why the bloodshed? Do you just want to give monkey island a bad name? We already have enough trouble as is."

Buy Eggs

[SteinHafen]
Walk past a small village centered around a pond. The pond has fish in it! Theres a small mountain and forest on this island! You see a blacksmith, an inn, a small library, and a windmill.

Harper takes you to the windmill where she makes you a cake. She rolls the egg through a rube goldberg machine which eventually bakes a cake!
