[[Brick]] gave the crew directions to a treasure cache

its on a small remote island. The island isnt super big, but it is absolutely covered in rainforest trees. Machette might be neccesary.

There seems to be a tomb in the middle of the forest.

On the tomb, there is a door. on the door, it reads:


"The thought of me brings sickness

The sight of me, despair

Falter while in battle

And you're sure to find me there.

And when your children mourn you

Do not weep or rage

Know that you have passed me down

To endure in them for an age."

There is a statue of a woman kneeling down with her hands flat out, above her head.

The riddle is solved when somebody pours blood onto the statue


Then theres a skeleton who has a riddle:

Never resting, never still.

Moving silently from hill to hill.

It does not walk, run or trot.

All is cool where it is not.

if you solve the riddle, he says "Correct!" his head explodes and the door opens

then theres another one:

Often held but never touched,

always wet but never rusts,

often bites but seldom bit,

to use me well you must have wit.
