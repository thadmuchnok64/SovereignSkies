[[Brick]] gave the crew directions to a treasure cache

its on a small remote island. The island isnt super big, but it is absolutely covered in rainforest trees. Machette might be neccesary.

There seems to be a tomb in the middle of the forest.

On the tomb, there is a door. on the door, it reads:


"The thought of me brings sickness

The sight of me, despair

Falter while in battle

And you're sure to find me there.

And when your children mourn you

Do not weep or rage

Know that you have passed me down

To endure in them for an age."

There is a statue of a woman kneeling down with her hands flat out, above her head.

The riddle is solved when somebody pours blood onto the statue


Then theres a skeleton who has a riddle:

Never resting, never still.

Moving silently from hill to hill.

It does not walk, run or trot.

All is cool where it is not.

if you solve the riddle, he says "Correct!" his head explodes and the door opens

then theres another one:

Often held but never touched,

always wet but never rusts,

often bites but seldom bit,

to use me well you must have wit.



After they get to the end, the gang finds a tomb of a vampire slayer. The skeleton has a whip in his right hand. A key on his belt, and a letter stuffed into his breastpoket

The letter says "if youre reading this and not my great grand son, put this letter back immediately. The fate of the seas depends on you putting it back!

Anyway, grandson... you came looking for answers. It is unfortunate i could not meet you in your lifetime.

The blood of the Archotechs surges through you. Are you worthy to seal away the evil in your time? The legacy of our bloodline rests on your shoulders.

I presume that demonic blood sucking bastard is back. If you truly have what it takes, take this whip and key to Oakbrook Manor and put him away for another century.

Good luck grandson. I will be watching over you.

PS: if you find my mother, [[Lydia]]'s, ashes. Can you bring them to [[Ashford University]]? It's what she would have wanted."
