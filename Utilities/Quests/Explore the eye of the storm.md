Harper wants [[Finnegan]] to explore the eye of the storm
She gives him a device that can measure storm currents.

There is a storm around trinity isles
Inside, there seems to be some blinking lights in the darkness

Three of the islands have lights.
There also seems to be a ship that is moving

On each island, is a large stone compass mechanism. In the center of these mechanisms, there appears to be a slot for an I-shaped hole.

The eye of the storm is noticable. It seems to be hovering around a central island.



When finnegan gets struck by lightning.

Finnegan wakes up. Alone. Finnegan is staring up at the storm above. Finnegan might notice a rocking of the boat. There is ocean. he pain of the lightning starts setting in now. Finnegan no longer has their backpack.

The storm seems to take shape of different creatures. Lions, Long dragons, Hawk, Bugs

"Hundereds of years into the future, and we're the only ones still with some fight in them. hmph predictable...
*Finnegan senses that this being is now focusing on them*

Greetings, tumultuous one. Wind is the most important element. Wind is change, adapting. Wind is resilience. Wind is freedom. Wind... is... a power. But do not be intimated. You *can* understand our ways, but first, you must make some transformations yourself. The next time we meet we will be in another time, but whatever you do, you must remember: "Feed the Wyvern"

Seemingly in an instance, the wind dissapears, and the night sky is revealed. 

The only bit of light seems to come from a flickering steel monument in the center island.
Finnegan can seemingly read this now.

"North Island points towards Snake Island"
"South East Island points towards Tornado Cove"
"South West Island points towards Ravishing Mermaid"
