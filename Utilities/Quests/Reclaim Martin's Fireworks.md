	Trade Route Plundered! A shipment of fireworks from [Stowaway] was supposed to make it to [Olive Harbor]. 350 gold reward if supplies recovered. Talk to [[Martin]], owner of [Fancy Fireworks] in [[Stowaway]] for reward. Martin suggests investigating the islands along the trade route.

~~If the gang goes on the tiny island near olive harbor

They find a note that says:

"Once you get the boom booms, bring them to the brick house without windows in the lowest part of [[Scallywag's Alley]]. And for the love of the gods remember to destroy this note this time! We don't want another banana-situation on our hands, now do we?"

[IN RIFTEN]

The only lead that the party has is that the thief fled into a storm drain on the side of the island.
Upon entering the sewer, everybody needs to do a constitution saving throw. In addition to smelling like shit, piss, and diseases, there seems to be evidence of homeless people sleeping near the drain.

Theres a homeless scitzoid druggie that the party can pay for information (10g? 20g?)

"Yeh, I think I may have seen a guy"
"Think he was holing up in that "


Party may notice a faint trail of gunpowder
They find a note that says:

The trail seems to lead to this rusty door. It takes some effort to get it open.

When opening the door, the party sees the remains of some banana peels, and a bit of gunpowder, and some fancy looking paper.

There also is a note there.

Eugene,

Once you get the boom booms, bring them to the red brick wall. There's a secret door there. Knock twice, pause, then knock three times. And for the love of the gods remember to destroy this note this time! We don't want another banana-situation on our hands, now do we?

Lots of love,
- Blartin
