A ship with two sails appears to be approaching you.

Says they are members of "The Federal Gaurd", which is connected to [[The Federation of Falconia]]

There are 5 of them above ship.
[four more below the decks. Two have cannons aimed directly at the ship, ready to fire.]

They claim to want to examine the ship's cargo in search of the drug [[Busterdust]]

A man with a fancy red jacket, leather boots, and a sailors hat walks towards the deck of the ship facing you.

claims his name is "William Castillo". 
*but his true identity is* [[Xavier]]

"Nice ship!"
"Hello everybody! Just a little formality. We need to make sure theres no illegal smuggling going on here. Apologies for the inconvenience."

claims this is part of a new initiative called the "Clean up the skies act", a degree by [[King Lynell]]

We're going to have to ask you all to stay in your cabins so we can inspect your cargo
