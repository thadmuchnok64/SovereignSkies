Riften is unlike anything anybody in the party has seen before.

There is more brick than grass or dirt. The streets are fancily laid out. Theres street lights, tall buildings, fancy architecture. There seems to be a variety of different smells in the air. As the gang seems to enter the city center, they are greeted by the smells of cinnamon rolls, then smoke, then flowers, then garbage and sewage. Finnegan also seems to smell the sweet sweet smell of busterdust

Upon getting to [[Riften]], the gang can decide to either park their boat in [Whiskey Row] which costs 5 gold per day to park there, Or they can park outside of the city.
Or they can park in scallywag's alley for 5 copper per day 
- [this has a risk of them getting their boat stolen]

* Upon getting off, the gang sees a bunch of bars.
* Harper explains that riften is split into an east side and a west side. The western side is mostly governmental and the university, and some housing.
* Eastern side is where most commerce happens.

There seems to be a distressed old man banging on a door to a building that says "CITIZEN'S AFFAIRS" It seems to be a part of the governmental district.

The gaurds dont seem to care.

"WHO TOOK-A MY-A FIREWORKS-A"
"THESE GOD-A-DAMN BANDITS KEEP TAKING THEM"
Then they can do that quest or not [[Reclaim Martin's Fireworks]]
