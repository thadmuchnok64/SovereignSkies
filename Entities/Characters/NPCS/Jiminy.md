a fire jenasi that uses his fire powers to power his goofy ass cart mechanism. Has a bunch of bells on different islands. If you ring them, he will be there in a jiffy.

Hangs around the [[Northeastern Region]]. Has a shop in [[Riften]]

He sells lots of stuff like potions and magic items.

Seems to vibe with [[Veritaz P Nubton]] quite a bit
