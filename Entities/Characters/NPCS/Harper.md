"Sorry we didnt free you earlier. We haven't ventured this far into the caves until now."

"Look, I'm going to be honest. Steinhafen is a great place, and I love the people there, but they're not fighters."

"Relations with the [[The Federation of Falconia]] have been souring a little bit. We depend on them for survival. They keep saying that people aren't returning from Backwater Bay and we have no idea why. We do see a lot of their ships leaving from steinhafen and headed towards monkey island though.

Monkey island isnt a dangerous place. We've always had pleasant trades with them."
