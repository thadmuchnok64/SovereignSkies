An event which caused the earth itself to "upheave."

This was because [[Earth God (Terra)]] was no satisfied with his place. He wished to be free like the wind.

In addition to the mass destruction of earth, The upper plane of earth was separated from the underdark. Underdark creatures were able to wreak havoc on creatures above.

Some people like the [[Colonials]] survived in a cryopod. Others such as the [[The Falcon Federation]] survived because of their mass wealth and power. The elves of [[The Drifters]] were able to survive by living in the feywild. Others were just lucky.
