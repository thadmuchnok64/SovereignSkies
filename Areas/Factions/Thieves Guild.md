inside is appears to look like it used to be a part of sewer. The interior is made of ornate bricks which are stacked in a dome-like shape. In the center of the dome, theres a lit brazier with some tents and mats surrounding it. Theres a bar on one side, some hallways which leads to individual rooms, and a big locked door next to the bar.

One part of the dome looks like it hsa been ripped off, and leads to a downward cave, which eventually leads to the sky. There is a small sloop docked at that part of the dome. It doesnt look big enough to fit anything larger than a sloop. That cave entrance also seems to have around a dozen cannons aimed towards it.
