Where [[Finnegan]] studied
[[Lydia]] was on the board of directors when the university was just starting out

"Sorry, due to some of our students being harassed by Scallywags, we're closing university buildings off from non-current-students. or faculty"

Has a magic library, a beautiful, large church

Also has a building for each school of magic:
[College of Conjuration] Seems to resemble a factory.
[College of Necromancy] The college, [[Lydia]] oversaw. Resembles a tomb.
[College of Evocation] Seems to resemble a military camp
[College of Abjuration] Very old architecture building.
[College of Transmutation] Patchwork building that is constantly falling apart, and being rebuilt.
[College of Divination] Churchy. [[Tato]] sometimes visits this place.
[College of Enchantment] Seems to be where most of the student government lives. Resembles a roman governmental building.
[College of Illusion] Almost perfectly silent inside here. Resembles a mansion.
