A small general store run by the daughter of Brick, [[Willow]]
Has a big sign thats been nailed to a house. The sign looks like it was ripped directly off a ship vessel.
On the sign it says in big white scratchy letters: "WILLOW'S EMPORIUM", then underneath it says in much neater letters: "General Store"
Willow is a shy little halfling girl, but happy to sell stuff to whoever enters.

Has a huge pile of packaged ration meals with a little lorie to load them onto a ship.
