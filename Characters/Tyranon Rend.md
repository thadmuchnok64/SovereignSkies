- the former Gnomish captain of Solomon Drift and The Starling’s Wager, was once a name cursed in every port and whispered in fear across the trade lanes. But to Drift, Rend was no more than a loud voice on the quarterdeck—a pompous figurehead draped in self-importance, content to bark orders while others did the bleeding and sweating.
    

When the time came, Drift acted. Quietly. Precisely. One windless night off the coast of Daggerpoint, he slipped away with a lean cut of the crew—those loyal not to Rend's gold, but to Drift’s ambition. They took the Wager right out from under the old captain’s nose, disappearing into the night like ghosts, leaving Rend behind with nothing but his shattered pride.

Drift hasn’t seen him since. But some nights, when the wind dies suddenly or a shadow moves the wrong way across the deck, he feels it—Tyranon Rend is still out there. Biding his time, waiting to take back what is his.
