Old senile gnome guy who was around when the colonials stepped out of the cryopods, and several decades before that. Talks about the before-times in bursts where he regains his memory.

Spends most of his time in his rocking chair, smoking his pipe.

Has two tufts of hair that block his eyes. A beard which is taller than him. A big pointy nose that pops out of the beard. Has a big droopy hat.

Lives in [[SteinHafen]]

Has a bunch of sticky notes around his house that remind him of what to do
